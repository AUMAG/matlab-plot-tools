# MATLAB PLOT TOOLS

This is a small collection of Matlab functions written for my amusement.
Some of them are listed on the Matlab File Exchange:

All are distributed under the two-clause BSD licence, which is the required
licence for all files listed in the File Exchange.

## History

This repository used to be called `matlabpkg` and had some old files I used in my PhD
years that I've since left by the wayside. These were removed July 2016 but should be easy
to find in the repository history.
